# Steps to Miles Calculator
### My motivation
This is a great tool for me to convert my steps I take everyday to see how many miles I walk each day. I'm currently trying to cut and walk as many miles as I can shred the fat.

### What problem does it solve?
It converts your steps you take every and converts it into miles
- It takes in your steps in
- The pace in which you go at
- Your gender
- Height

and all this will go converting your steps to miles

### My Plan
I want to make a step calculator that will calculate how many miles I've done today and then be able to set a goal and tell me how many more steps I need to reach that goal

- calculate
  - Need to obviously input how many steps I take
  - input my speed in which im walking/running
  - take gender into consideration
  - take height into consideration
  - find the stride length
  - Calculate into miles

- set a goal
  - input the goal I want
  - calculate how many steps I'm at currently from last input and tell me how many steps I need to take + how many miles that is

### What makes your project stand out?
- This is my first ever python project, I'm trying to learn python by creating projects I find entertaining.
